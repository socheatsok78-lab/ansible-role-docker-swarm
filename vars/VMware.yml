# Overlay networking and NSX

# If you are running NSX on your VMware environment you will likely run into issues with Docker's overlay networking.
# In particular, overlay networking uses UDP port 4789 by default which conflicts with VMware NSX's communication port for VXLAN.
#
# To resolve this, you can change the data path port for your Docker Swarm setup to a different value (for example, 9789):
