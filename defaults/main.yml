# Choices:
# - "present" ← (default) to create/update a new cluster
# - "remove" to teardown the existing cluster
# 
# Set to remove, to remove an absent node from the cluster. Note that removing requires Docker SDK for Python >= 2.4.0.
# community.docker.docker_node can be used to demote a manager before removal.
docker_swarm_state: present

# The node listens for inbound swarm manager traffic on this address.
# The default is to listen on 0.0.0.0:2377.
# It is also possible to specify a network interface to listen on that interface's address; for example --listen-addr eth0:2377.
# 
# Specifying a port is optional. If the value is a bare IP address or interface name, the default port 2377 will be used.

docker_swarm_listen_addr: "0.0.0.0:{{ docker_swarm_listen_port }}"

# This flag specifies the address that will be advertised to other members of the swarm for API access and overlay networking.
# If unspecified, Docker will check if the system has a single IP address, and use that IP address with the listening port (see --listen-addr).
# If the system has multiple IP addresses, --advertise-addr must be specified so that the correct address is chosen for inter-manager
# communication and overlay networking.
# 
# It is also possible to specify a network interface to advertise that interface's address; for example --advertise-addr eth0:2377.
# 
# Specifying a port is optional. If the value is a bare IP address or interface name, the default port 2377 will be used.
docker_swarm_advertise_addr: "{{ ansible_host }}:{{ docker_swarm_listen_port }}"

# This flag specifies the address that global scope network drivers will publish towards other nodes in order to reach the containers running on this node.
# Using this parameter it is then possible to separate the container's data traffic from the management traffic of the cluster.
# If unspecified, Docker will use the same IP address or interface that is used for the advertise address.
docker_swarm_data_path_addr:

# This flag allows you to configure the UDP port number to use for data path traffic.
# The provided port number must be within the 1024 - 49151 range. If this flag is not set or is set to 0, the default port number 4789 is used.
# The data path port can only be configured when initializing the swarm, and applies to all nodes that join the swarm.
